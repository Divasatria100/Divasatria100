# 👋 Hi, I’m Diva!  

Welcome to my GitHub profile!
I’m a student at Politeknik Negeri Batam, majoring in Informatics Engineering with a focus on Software Engineering Technology. This repository is where I document my learning process, build small projects, and turn ideas into practical implementations.

I’m interested in web and mobile development, and I enjoy exploring how code can be used to solve real-world problems. I’ve been working with Flutter for mobile development and exploring Linux as a development environment to strengthen my technical foundation.

I like experimenting, learning from mistakes, and gradually improving how I write code making it cleaner, more efficient, and more meaningful. Every project here represents progress, and that’s what keeps me motivated to keep learning.

If you’d like to connect or collaborate, feel free to reach out on **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/diva-satria-18159430a/)**.  
Let’s share ideas and maybe even build something impactful together!  

✨ *Keep learning, stay curious, and let your code tell your story.* ✨
