# 👋 Hi, I’m Diva!  

Welcome to my GitHub profile!  
I’m a first-year student at **Politeknik Negeri Batam**, majoring in **Informatics Engineering** with a focus on **Software Engineering Technology**.  
Here, I share my journey as I explore the world of programming, build small projects, and learn how to turn ideas into something real.  

I’m passionate about **web and mobile development**, and I love discovering how code can make life easier and solve real-world problems.  
This semester, I’ve started diving deeper into **Flutter** for mobile development and exploring **Linux** as an operating system to strengthen my technical foundation.  

I enjoy experimenting, learning from mistakes, and pushing myself to write cleaner, smarter, and more meaningful code.  
Every project I build is a reflection of progress and that’s what keeps me excited to grow every day.  

If you’d like to connect or collaborate, feel free to reach out on **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/diva-satria-18159430a/)**.  
Let’s share ideas and maybe even build something impactful together!  

✨ *Keep learning, stay curious, and let your code tell your story.* ✨
