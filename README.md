# 👋 Hi, I’m Diva!  

Welcome to my GitHub profile!  
I’m a first-year student at **Politeknik Negeri Batam**, majoring in **Informatics Engineering with a focus on Software Engineering Technology**.  
Here, I share my journey as I explore the world of programming, build small projects, and learn how to turn ideas into something real.  

I’m passionate about **software and web development**, and I love discovering how code can solve real-world problems.  
Right now, I’m diving deep into **Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP**, sharpening both my logic and creativity through every project I make.  

I enjoy experimenting, learning from mistakes, and pushing myself to write cleaner, smarter, and more meaningful code.  
I believe every line of code is a step toward growth and that’s what keeps me excited to keep learning every day.  

If you’d like to connect or collaborate, you can find me on **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/diva-satria-18159430a/)**.  
Let’s connect, share ideas, and maybe even build something impactful together!  

✨ *Keep learning, stay curious, and let your code tell your story.* ✨
